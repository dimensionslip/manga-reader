# Manga Reader
This repository contains my long-overdue generalized JavaScript manga reader code. It has been optimized for use in Tumblr custom pages, but will work in other websites as well, as this is a static html code.

##Terms of Use:

* **DO NOT REMOVE THE CREDIT.** This means keeping the credit in the source code intact, as well as the credit link on the page itself. You may move the credit link to another part of the page, but it should have the same amount of visibility as where the original link was placed.
* **DO NOT RELEASE OR CLAIM AS YOUR OWN.** This should be self-explanatory.
* **DO NOT USE MY CODE AS A BASE TO MAKE YOUR OWN.** A good knowledge of HTML and CSS can more or less net you an equivalent of that.
* **DO NOT REPOST THE GRAPHICS USED AS A SAMPLE.** These are pages I translated/helped translate and I have a strict no reposting policy when it comes to things I have worked on as a scanlator.
* **YOU MAY LIGHTLY/HEAVILY EDIT THE CODE, BUT NOT REMOVE THE CREDIT AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE IT.** You are free to make full use of the customization options available—it is why I made them, after all—but no matter how much you tweak it and/or the base code, you are not allowed to redistribute the code in any manner.


##Before asking any theme or page-related question:
